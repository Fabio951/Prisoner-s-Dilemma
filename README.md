# Prisoner-s-Dilemma


This project simulates a Prisoners dilemma multi-stage evolutionary game. All the details can be found in the presentation_many.ipynb file.
It contains over 20 types of Bayesian player, each of them following a different strategy. The evolution of the population is showed with high-level dinamic visualization. Also, some optimizations have been implemented in order to speed up the code, which let the program go up to 1.000 prisoners per epoch and hundreds of stages per challenge, with pretty quick computational time (couple of minutes per epoch).

The main file is Presentation_many.ipynb, which contains a thorough presentation of this project. It is suggested to look just at this file, which explain every part of the code.

For a deeper insight of the code, classes_many.ipynb contains the definition of all the classes, options_many.ipynb contains all the initialization options of the program, Functions_many.ipynb contains all the functions used in the program, divided in topics.


!!! This Project is an early stage project. It may contain bugs and the coding strategy is not optimal. The program has been completed 4 months after starting to learn Python.
